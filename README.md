Requirements Met
----------------
1. Javascript - we made our own objects for the map, for paths, a counter utility, and the entire user input form is an object
2. Canvas - we have a canvas element
3. HTML - we have forms, we dynamically make new HTML elements through js
4. CSS - we use the skeleton library, which includes a reset, fluid layout, etc.
5. DOM manipulation - as mentioned, many things such as forms are dynamically inserted into the DOM
6. AJAX consumption - we use the google maps library heavily
7. jQuery - most of our DOM manipulation is done through jQuery

Robust app - we believe our app is useful, and in our use it has worked well. For now, it is specific the the CMU / Pittsburgh area, but we hope to expand its use case for a later unit or term project

User interface - we use appealing colors / patterns, and in our testing among random friends, they have found the interface to be intuitive. Another note: when you click the markers you lay out, it will move the marker to the next possible location from the search list. Same if you click the dropdown below your location input.

Code style - our code is formatted properly. We realized late in the game that our editors were set to different spacing widths (2 spaces, 4 spaces), so that threw things off a bit, but overall it looks fine
